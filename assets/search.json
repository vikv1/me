        "excerpt": "Last quarter, I took an acting class. Having been reserved my entire life, this was a decision no one probably would’ve seen coming. I definitely did not anticipate my enrolling in this class.\n\nWhen I registered, it was for two reasons:\n\n  I wanted to improve my public speaking skills\n  I wanted to be able to finish the course early so I could start my internship\n\n\nIn regards to the first point, I am significantly better at public speaking now than I ever was. Playing a dramatic character on stage makes doing a presentation look like nothing. As for the second point, I had to do my final performance 2-3 weeks early, which went great!\n\nAfter I had registered for this class, my inner voice was of course telling me not to do it because I could take an ‘easier’ class that I wouldn’t have to be uncomfortable in. Sometime during the week after I signed up for the course, a spot opened up in a totally online, asynchronous course on something related to music. Logically speaking, this would’ve been much less effort. No class meeting times, and no pushing of my comfort zone. I ruminated on whether I should do it or not. I was close to registering for this class, but I ultimately didn’t.\n\nWhy not stay comfortable? I could always just do more presentations right? Wouldn’t the async class give me more free time to, I don’t know, study?\n\nHonestly, I felt like I would’ve been running away. I knew that every reason I would come up with would be an excuse. Main takeaway? We tend to trust our own thoughts for no reason other than that they’re our own, and often times we subconsciously value relatively short-term comfort at the cost of long-term growth.\n",

I’ve realized Seattle and its surrounding areas are just a microcosm of what kinds of people, ideas, and things there are to experience. I’m definitely much more open to the idea of living in various other countries in the future.\n\n\nIn terms of engineering at large companies, I’ve noticed that it’s much harder to apply the mindset of ‘just build things’ due to a variety of factors.\n\n  A certain software library may be unauthorized for use\n  You may be waiting on approval for access to a certain API that is blocking your project\n  Your point of contact for critical information be out of office (good for them!)\n\n\nThe ‘bureaucracy’ has been a new experience, one that I’ve come to appreciate. More importantly, I am enjoying building things alongside a knowledgeable team, just as much as I had hoped before starting this position.\n",

        "excerpt": "The professor is a very engaging lecturer, although the lectures I feel are relatively short. I’m already starting to see and think about how this can applied to performing large calculations, although I’d like to look more into how these calculations can be done faster. Currently we can define an upper bound of O(n3) for matrix multiplication because we have to perform n2 calculations for each row in the matrix. There are some faster algorithms like Strassen’s and Coppersmith-Winograd’s which reduce the overall time complexity to just under n3.\n\nA cool improvement although the drawback of analyzing algorithms solely by their asymptotic upper bound is that we ignore constant factors which (unfortunately) do affect our real execution speed. I’d like to look more into this though!\n",

Install it, configure it, tweak it, push it.\n\nFork it  github\n\n Buy me a coffee ☕️\n Tweet it  twitter\n\n Install Alembic ⚗️\n\nFeatures\n\n\n  Available as a theme gem and GitHub Pages theme\n  Clear and elegant design that can be used out of the box or as solid starting point\n  Tested in all major browsers, including IE and Edge\n  Built in Service Worker so it can work offline and on slow connections\n  Configurable colours and typography in a single settings file\n  Extensive set of shortcodes to include various elements; such as buttons, icons, figure images and more\n  Solid typographic framework from Sassline\n  Configurable navigation via a single file\n  Modular Jekyll components\n  Post category support in the form of a single post index page grouped by category\n  Built in live search using JavaScript\n  Contact form built in using Formspree\n  Designed with Siteleaf in mind\n  Has 9 of the most popular networks as performant sharing buttons\n  Has documentation\n\n\nExamples\n\nHere are a few examples of Alembic out in the wild being used in a variety of ways:\n\n\n  bawejakunal.github.io\n  case2111.github.io\n  karateca.org\n\n\nInstallation\n\nQuick setup\n\nTo give you a running start I’ve put together some starter kits that you can download, fork or even deploy immediately:\n\n\n  ⚗️🍨 Vanilla Jekyll starter kit\n\n  ⚗️🌲 Forestry starter kit\n\n\n  \n    ⚗️💠 Netlify CMS starter kit\n\n  \n  \n    ⚗️:octocat: GitHub Pages with remote theme kit\nDownload kit\n  \n  ⚗️🚀 Stackbit starter kit\n\n\n\nAs a Jekyll theme\n\n\n  Add gem \"alembic-jekyll-theme\" to your Gemfile to add the theme as a dependancy\n  Run the command bundle install in the root of project to install the theme and its dependancies\n  Add theme: alembic-jekyll-theme to your _config.yml file to set the site theme\n  Run bundle exec jekyll serve to build and serve your site\n  Done! Use the configuration documentation and the example _config.yml file to set things like the navigation, contact form and social sharing buttons\n\n\nAs a GitHub Pages remote theme\n\n\n  Add gem \"jekyll-remote-theme\" to your Gemfile to add the theme as a dependancy\n  Run the command bundle install in the root of project to install the jekyll remote theme gem as a dependancy\n  Add jekyll-remote-theme to the list of plugins in your _config.yml file\n  Add remote_theme: daviddarnes/alembic@main to your _config.yml file to set the site theme\n  Run bundle exec jekyll serve to build and serve your site\n  Done! Use the configuration documentation and the example _config.yml file to set things like the navigation, contact form and social sharing buttons\n\n\nAs a Boilerplate / Fork\n\n(deprecated, not recommended)\n\n\n  Fork the repo\n  Replace the Gemfile with one stating all the gems used in your project\n  Delete the following unnecessary files/folders: .github, LICENSE, screenshot.png, CNAME and alembic-jekyll-theme.gemspec\n  Run the command bundle install in the root of project to install the jekyll remote theme gem as a dependancy\n  Run bundle exec jekyll serve to build and serve your site\n  Done! Use the configuration documentation and the example _config.yml file to set things like the navigation, contact form and social sharing buttons\n\n\nCustomising\n\nWhen using Alembic as a theme means you can take advantage of the file overriding method. This allows you to overwrite any file in this theme with your own custom file, by matching the file name and path. The most common example of this would be if you want to add your own styles or change the core style settings.\n\nTo add your own styles copy the styles.scss into your own project with the same file path (assets/styles.scss). From there you can add your own styles, you can even optionally ignore the theme styles by removing the @import \"alembic\"; line.\n\nIf you’re looking to set your own colours and fonts you can overwrite them by matching the variable names from the _settings.scss file in your own styles.scss, make sure to state them before the @import \"alembic\"; line so they take effect. The settings are a mixture of custom variables and settings from Sassline - follow the link to find out how to configure the typographic settings.\n",
